Marketing A/B testing, often simply referred to as A/B testing, is a method used in marketing to compare two versions of a marketing asset or strategy to determine which one performs better. These assets or strategies could include emails, advertisements, landing pages, call-to-action buttons, or any other element of a marketing campaign. The goal of A/B testing in marketing is to optimize marketing efforts by identifying the most effective strategies for driving desired outcomes, such as clicks, conversions, purchases, or engagement.
